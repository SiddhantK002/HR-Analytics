HR Analytics: Employees Attrition and Performance analysis.

Project Overview: The HR Analytics Project aims to analyze employee data to uncover key insights related to attrition, performance, and workforce engagement. Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, we conducted scenario-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify factors influencing employee retention, salary trends, and performance metrics. The project delivers an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key HR KPIs, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to enhance workforce planning and reduce attrition.
